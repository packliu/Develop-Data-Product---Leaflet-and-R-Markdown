my_trip <- data.frame(name = c("Seattle", "Mt. Rainier", "Vancouver"), 
                      pop = c(142.07, 369.3, 114.97), 
                      lat = c(47.608013, 46.879967, 49.246292),
                      lng = c(-122.335167, -121.726906, -123.116226))
my_trip %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(weight = 1, radius = sqrt(my_trip$pop)*5000)
my_trip
```
